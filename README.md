# FAQ-Automated-Question-Answering

#### The basic idea of this project is to automatically retrieve a suitable response to user's questions from FAQs. Often websites have comprehensive FAQs, but manually searching and finding the answer to a specific question from these FAQs is not trivial. The purpose of this exercise is to answer user queries by automatically retrieving the closest question and answer from predefined FAQs when appropriate. I have used a dataset of FAQs which I have made myself by searching the most frequently asked question from the Internet.The basic strategy to this will be finding an FAQ question that is closest in meaning to the user query and then it will display to the user. For this, the efficient way of computing the semantic similarity between two sentences is converting each sentence into vectors and then using cosine similarity between the vectors to come up with a distance measure between sentences that indicates how similar they are in meaning and for this I have used various models/embeddings such as Bag Of Words, Word2Vec, Glove etc.
