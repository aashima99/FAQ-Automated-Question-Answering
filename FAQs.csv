What are the benefits of a Data Science certification?,"There are definitely some advantages that come along with a data science certification, it reflects your interest in the field of data science but there’s a caveat – due to the boom of data science, there has been a massive uptake of these courses which makes them common or general. So what can you do in this situation?

If you are to take up free certification courses provided by multiple MOOC websites, it will definitely reflect your interest in this field but it won’t help you stand out. To stand apart from the crowd, you will need to take up a course that provides you with industry exposure and high-quality projects. A certification that is taken up as a standard to measure great talent."
Should I participate in hackathons? Will that help me in getting a job?,"Data Science competitions provide an amazing opportunity and platform to showcase the skillset that you have developed over a brief period. It helps you understand the domain, the techniques, the flow of a machine learning project and gives a good sense of direction.

A majority of recruiters give keen attention to past hackathon performances. So if you haven’t started participating now is the time. Don’t worry if you have a fear of hackathon submission, it can be overwhelming sometimes. You can check out HackLive – a guided community hackathon through which you can master the art of participating in a hackathon."

What are the Most Common Mistakes Data Science enthusiasts make in an Interview?,"Let’s discuss the most common mistakes made by data science enthusiasts one-by-one:

Preparing only theoretical topics without applying them
Let’s say that you are in the middle of a data science interview and the interviewer asks you – What is random forest and how does it work? Being a simple and standard question you answer the question smoothly. Then the follow-up zinger comes – How would you improve the performance of the model in the context of the business?
Now, unless you have solved a data science problem previously using random forest and tuned its hyperparameters, you won’t be able to give a proper answer which can lead to doubt in the mind of the interviewer.

Assuming what you see in ML Competitions is what Real-Life Jobs are like
There’s no better to prepare for a data science role than participating in machine learning competitions. This is undeniable. The problem is it doesn’t make you an industry-ready professional. Usually, the interviews include case studies that test your problem-solving skills and domain knowledge and these are usually gained with experience.

Using too many Data Science Terms
Your resume is a profile of what you have accomplished and how you did it – not a list of things to simply jot down. When a recruiter looks at your resume, he/she wants to understand your background and what all you have accomplished in a neat and summarized manner. If half the page is filled with vague data science terms like linear regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, without any explanation, your resume might not clear the screening round.

Not working on Communication Skills 
Communications skills are one of the most underrated and least talked about aspects a data scientist absolutely MUST possess. You can learn all the latest techniques, master multiple tools, and make the best graphs, but if you cannot explain your analysis to your client, you will fail as a data scientist. This is what the interviewer will be testing in the interview process."
What’s the impact of Covid on hiring for DS roles?,"Hiring is going to slow down. First in small companies then eventually in enterprises  in a couple of months. But it is likely to pick up in a few months. Hence, if you are looking to transition, this is a good time to ramp up skills and learn new things that might usually take some time. "
